            I hope this finds you well! Narnia is even more magical than I
            imagined. The landscapes are breathtaking, and I've met the most
            fascinating creatures, including Aslan himself. Every day here is an
            adventure. I visited Cair Paravel and was awed by its beauty. I wish
            you could see it with me! Sending you lots of love and a touch of
            Narnian magic. Can't wait to share my stories when I return.
